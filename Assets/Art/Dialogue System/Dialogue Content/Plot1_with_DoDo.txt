You have arrived, my dear Princess of Elven Magic.
Your presence brings hope in these dark times.
A
Your Majesty, it is an honor to stand before you.
How may I serve our kingdom?
B
I have a task of utmost importance for you, Princess.
The realm is threatened by the malevolent presence of the Demon King.
A
The Demon King... I have heard tales of his cruelty and power.
What would you have me do, Your Majesty?
B
You are our kingdom's last hope, Princess.
I entrust you with a quest of great peril and significance.
A
I accept this daunting task, Your Majesty.
I will not falter in the face of adversity.

I have faith in your abilities, Princess.
Your courage and magic are unmatched.
A
Thank you, Your Majesty.
With this blade in hand, I will face the Demon King.
B
Go forth, Princess, and may the light of the elves guide your path.
The fate of our realm rests in your hands.
A
I shall not disappoint you, Your Majesty.
I will return triumphant, with the head of the Demon King.
B
Godspeed, brave Princess.
May the winds carry you safely to your destiny.
The future of our realm depends on your courage and strength.
Farewell, and may fortune favor you on your quest.
